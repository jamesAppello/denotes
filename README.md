The goal of this application was an attempt to solve an interesting, yet complex concept, "attention dilation."

## Time Dilation
Have you ever noticed that an hour can feel faster/slower depending on what you are doing within a given time interval?
### THAT IS THE TYPE OF CONCEPT THAT HAS A CORRELATION TO IT'S COUNTERPART:: "ATTENTION"

## Thought's and memories, thought you can see into your mind, your thoughts and/or memories run through your conscience like "images"/"frames"/"nodes" (in a sense, similar to how a linked list works).
The complex part here is to aim to formulate a unit of measurement for "thought-node" shifts, what links one thought to the other?
* Are they linked by symmetric/asymetric memory of related/somewhat-related events?
* ... by recollection of a pattern you may have noticed at one time, but had a 'dejavoo' moment?

This may seem arbitrary, however, I felt it was something fascinating to try to create a unit of measuring these thought node shifts in attention.
This is something I felt would help those whom, like me have ADD/ADHD. As a means to act as a way to help navigate through the stresses that come from it (either being manic, angry, depressed, etc.)

Another thing I felt this could one day become would be to help keep AI from getting out of hand and to avoid an Orwellian like future if AI were to take over.
(this may seem really "out there," I understand if that's how this may appear from the 3rd person POV)

### If anything I did find this a facinating concept to understand. Though it may have taken a bit of a toll on me, if I am successful, I tried to saved the good hearted people a massive headache.
